# Alura and Pluralsight HTML - CSS - JavaScript - VueJS - IIS - NodeJS Courses
📝 Alura/Pluralsight Courses i'm doing for work. This is not orginized at all, and it's not supposed to be. I've followed the courses very faithfully so feel free to take a look if you're doing any of them. The names might not be accurate though lol 🙃

### Running :japanese_ogre:

:clown_face: I'm not gonna put instructions on how to run all of these here, since they're just courses i'm going through for my work training.
